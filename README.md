# Mathematical-Finance-and-Stochastic-Process
Stamatics 2021

## Objectives 

The goal of this project is to introduce the students with basics of finance and teach them elementary topics in the two major sub-fields of mathematical finance - portfolio theory & derivatives pricing theory.

## Weekly meetings

We will have weekly meetings on **Monday 8PM** where we would go over the topics in the coming week and also the students can discuss any of their doubts here. Click on this [link](https://zoom.us/j/94390458025?pwd=dEZYZU1IUVMvRmNNckxza1ZIUEY2dz09) to join the meeting.

## Ratification requirements

The sudents who have been allotted the project officially and wish to obtain the certificate of completion from Stamatics must meet certain requirements. In particular, they must submit the assignments and regularly attend the meetings. (screenshots will be taken of the zoom meeting to identify the attendees).

## Additional Notes
