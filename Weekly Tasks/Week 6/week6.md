# Week 6 Tasks
** IMPORTANT: This file will be consntantly updated throughout the week so keep checking it out regularly. ** 
This week we will learn the basics of a special class of stochastic processes which are essential to us. Discussing this material in all its mathematical rigour is beyond the scope of this project amd so
we will study the methods used in proving the Black-Scholes formula and assume that the underlying math works unequivocally.
