# Week 2 Tasks

## Probability & Statistics
* Complete the next two weeks (weeks 3 & 4) of the [probability and statistics course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-theory-statistics). (You can audit the course for now as you don't need to do the assignments.)
* Those people who are already familiar with expectations and covariances, can directly move on to the [Corporate Finance[(https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance-essentials)] course and complete the first 3 weeks of that course.
* I will also be uploading some typeset notes on probability and statistics which would cover the important topics concisely and would have some practice problems. 

## Python & Data Analysis
This remains the same as last week as the deadline was too tight. 
* Complete the first two weeks of the [Data Science with Python course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis). (Also apply for financial aid on this course.
