# Week 5 Tasks

This week we will begin our study of 'Derivative Pricing Theory'. Before delving into the maths behind this theory, we would learn what exactly are derivatives and that is the goal for this week. 

# Derivatives
- Cover Week 2 and Week 3 of the [Financial Engineering and Risk Management 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-engineering-1) course. 
- Another great resource for learning about derivates is the excellent book **Options, Futures and Other Derivates** by **J.C. Hull**.

# Probability and Statistics Revision
Derivative Pricing theory relies heavily on tools from probability and statistics to explain the pricing of these financial instruments. We will delve into the theory of stochastic
processes from next week and a good understanding of probability and statistics is necessary for understanding it. 
- Revise the probability & statistics learned previously in the course.
